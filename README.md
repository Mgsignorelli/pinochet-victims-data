# Deaths and Disappearances in the Pinochet Regime: A New Dataset

This Github repository contains data and documented R code for [Deaths and Disappearances in the Pinochet Regime: A New Dataset](https://osf.io/rm4y8) by Freire et al (2017).

> **Abstract**: How did the Pinochet regime use deaths and disappearances after the violent military coup in September 1973? The coup resulted in more than three decades of violence as General Pinochet's government fought against left-wing movements for the sake of the 'national wellbeing.' While these efforts were significant, they were not uniformly distributed spatially or over time during his regime. This paper provides new data on observed variation of regime-based violence. It codes and compiles data from two volumes of the Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation, a systematic investigation of the Pinochet regime published in 1991. The data documents the initially high-level and then steep decline of these atrocities, the extent to which victims were targeted, and other demographic information about the victims. Our data also includes geographic information system data that allows researchers to map the spatial variation of atrocities over time.
